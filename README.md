Hello! If you are the newest Research Assistant tasked with updating this website, feel free to reach me at the following emails:

Please make a Github account if you don't have one already, and I'll add you as a collaborator. 

This website was designed for Dr. Ajmera's paper regarding hepatic decompensation. It was built using simple frameworks: Bootstrap for HTML/CSS Styling and a Chart.JS plugin for the requested bar chart. I've kept the Javascript native for simplicity.

If you do not have any coding background, I recommend you lookup the basics of Bootstrap and HTML to add whatever text as needed. Email me if you cannot sort it out, and I'll look into it when I can. I've commented where I can to help make edits easier. If you are confident in your coding abilities, code away! 

Note: We are using Google Domains and it is tied to my jyeung36@gmail.com account. Please email me for domain access if any issues arises.
