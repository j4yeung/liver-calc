            <h4>Discussion</h4>
            <p>In this multi-center, international study of adults with NAFLD, we found that a multivariable MRE-based model with age, AST, albumin, and platelets 
                best predicted the risk of hepatic decompensation in training and validation cohorts. The diagnostic accuracy of the MRE-based multivariable model 
                for the 3- and 5-year risk of decompensation remained between 0.88-0.90 in training and validation cohorts and was superior to FIB-4.
                 The combination of clinical parameters widely available in routine practice with MRE may offer more refined risk prediction for patients with 
                 NAFLD. Applying the multivariable regression model as an online calculator can quickly yield the 3- and 5-year risk of hepatic decompensation to guide 
                 clinical management and patient counselling. In addition, models to predict HCC and all-cause mortality outperformed FIB-4, had good diagnostic accuracy
                  and warrant validation in external cohorts. </p>
            <div class="line"></div>

            <h4>In Context With Published Literature</h4>
            <p>Fibrosis stage on liver biopsy has been adopted as a surrogate marker for future liver-related outcomes in clinical trials based on longitudinal studies demonstrating its association with liver-related outcomes and death. (8, 12) Recently, studies have demonstrated the direct association of non-invasive tests (NITs) such as FIB-4 index (27, 28), liver stiffness on vibration-controlled transient elastography (29), and MRE (20, 22, 30, 31) on liver-related events. The combination of NITs may offer enhanced risk prediction for liver-related events and to date, this has been evaluated with the MEFIB index, combining MRE and FIB-4, which had a high negative predictive value (20). Boursier et al.(32) reported on the sequential combination of FIB-4 and VCTE and demonstrated a strong association with liver-related events. Here, we evaluated a candidate set of variables and then formed a multivariable model for hepatic decompensation that retained excellent diagnostic accuracy in a multi-ethnic validation cohort. Using the multivariable model, the estimated 3- and 5-year risk of hepatic decompensation can be provided in clinical care, presenting a more granular understanding of a patientâs individual risk. This approach resembles risk stratification in cardiovascular disease through Framingham (33) and ASCVD (34) risk scores and if validated, may inform the need for treatment in patients with NAFLD.
                Importantly, MRE-based models for HCC and all-cause mortality also demonstrated good diagnostic accuracy and outperformed FIB-4. As the utilization of liver biopsy in NAFLD decreases, the ability to predict HCC risk and determine the need for screening without overt evidence of cirrhosis remains an unmet need. In our study, T2DM was associated with hepatic decompensation and HCC on univariable analysis but did not remain a significant predictor in multivariable models. In our cohort, there T2DM was collinear with age and MRE, which resulted in T2DM not remaining in the multivariable model.  
                 </p>
            <div class="line"></div>

            <h4>Strengths and Limitations</h4>
            <p> This study has several notable strengths. First, our international multi-center, multi-ethnic cohort included a large sample size of > 1,300
                 patients who underwent baseline MRE and laboratory tests, making this one of the largest studies of NAFLD-related outcomes. Furthermore, 
                 the high number of incident hepatic decompensation events (n=85, 6.5%) allowed for adequate power to assess multivariable models in a training 
                 and validation cohort. However, this was a retrospective study of patients at academic medical centers. Nevertheless, future, multicenter,
                  prospective studies will be required to validate the prognostic role of an MRE-based prediction model. 
                In addition, MRE was only assessed at a single time point in this study. So far, only a few studies demonstrated an association between
                 change in MRE and change in liver histology in cohorts of 50-100 patients.(19, 35) A recent study evaluated the impact of change in MRE 
                 on liver-related outcomes and demonstrated that progression in liver stiffness on MRE in 29 patients with compensated cirrhosis was associated
                  with hepatic decompensation or death (36).  Future studies may evaluate if serial MRE measurements over time can refine the prediction of
                   future liver-related events, however, the clinical value of accurate risk prediction with a single MRE value remains significant.
